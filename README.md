[Click to see example](https://github.com/galacticquasardev/Terbium-Executor/blob/master/te.png)

# Features 
Lets you put in your own scripts and inject it (like any normal roblox executor lol)
Puts basic scripts from a couple games into it with a second menu

# Instructions to Download:
1: Download from releases tab
2: Open and boom

# Flagged as virus:
The executor will be flagged as a virus because of it injecting the files and scripts into the game, so windows and other antiviruses misfire and call it a virus. Windows smart screen will also stop you from opening it because it's "unofficial". but for an official app you would have to pay for it to be signed and marked as clear.
